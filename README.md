### Special modifications

1. A `<ui-icon>` component has been created that covers the functionality of nuxt-icon. There is also a module written for it that scans the ~/assets/icon folder and generates a `types` based on the files. Adds hints to the icon name when using the component
2. A `<core-scope>` is a "god" component, it avoids duplication of initialization code and is a repository of the necessary components throughout the application.
3. Plugin `1.initialization.ts` - initialization you're app here - validate token, request the site configuration, etc.
4. Plugin `2.eventBus.ts` - wrapper over the `mitt` package for convenient use
5. A `app/api` api folder support auto-imports a.k.a composable, for details see [homepage](./app/pages/index.vue)
